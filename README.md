# smal Video managment application in React JS
   ---- I build this project in order to learn React and Implement the best practices of the librar. the application is for manging video,
   that includes : UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE if you have the right access. the application have a user base and all the users can Like/Dislike
   a movie, but ONLY the Admin can put the rating of a movie even change the number in stock of a certain movie ( UPDATE ) and DELETE and 
   CREATE a movie.
   
   Step 1 : go Inside Vidly folder :
   step 2 : clone to the repo
   step 3 : run "npm install"
   step 3 : run "npm start"
   this should start the application.
   
   - the application uses fake services that build to act as a Back API that responds with JSON data, However I had to use a real API
   to ensure( test ) the multipule errors that we could ran into (400, 403, 404, 500, ...) so that my React reacts to all the scenarios 
   that we could ran into and not crash. take a look at the code. I hope you can see readable code and I welcome any seggestion
